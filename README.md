## Purpose

This site presents professional experience, public flagship projects, selected
professional work (high-level only), technical skills, and contact options.

Featured work, in order:

1. Artifact Repository Service
2. PathBus case study
3. Flutter Bluetooth Platform
4. Personal Portfolio

Selected professional work follows that list (Mabe, then Biosense) and is
summarized without private repositories, client screenshots, or proprietary
implementation details.

## Deployment

GitHub Actions deploys `dist/` to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main`.

- Canonical domain: `https://brayanolivares.com`
- Vite `base: "/"`
- `public/CNAME` contains `brayanolivares.com`
- Workflow also runs `npm run lint` before build

---

## Accessibility

- Semantic landmarks and labeled form controls
- Keyboard-accessible navigation and scroll-to-top button
- `:focus-visible` styles
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support (including disabled particles)
- External links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"`

---

## Featured-project strategy

Flagship projects are public portfolio repositories with reusable cards and
portfolio-owned SVG visuals.

Selected professional work uses generic visuals and high-level descriptions
only. No private repository links and no client UI screenshots are published.
